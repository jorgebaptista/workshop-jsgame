# Rock, Paper, Scissors (Lizard, Spock)

A Javascript game made in a workshop.

In order to handle user input outside of a browser window (e.g. terminal), this code uses the **prompt-sync** [Node Module](https://github.com/heapwolf/prompt-sync) as a simpler alternative to the built-in **process** object and **readline** module.

This game is a simple rock, paper, scissors game with a twist. Play it [here](https://jorgebaptista.github.io/workshop-jsgame/rps-game/index.html)!
